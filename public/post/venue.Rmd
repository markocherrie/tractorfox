**VENUE CONFIRMED**
We are happy to announce that the 23rd of December has been booked at the [Roseburn bar](https://www.roseburnbar.co.uk) hire room, also known as the Rosey B VIP.

**VENUE CANCELLED**
Unfortunately, the Rosey B VIP had to cancel due to the rugby being on. Fortunately, Steven and Summer donated their abode to welcome the TractorFox delegates.
